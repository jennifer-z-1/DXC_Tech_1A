# Overview
The purpose of this project is to create an AI-driven chatbot that effectively understands and interprets the EU AI Act. 
By implementing a multi-agent approach, we focus on effective prompt engineering and risk assessment to ensure compliance with EU AI regulations.

We aim to present a fully functional prototype that demonstrates:
- Effective PDF parsing capabilities
- A well-structured knowledge base
- A system able to assess risks and provide advice in alignment with the EU AI Act for businesses.


# Approaches and Techniques
This framework combines the strengths of generative large language models (LLMs) with traditional information retrieval systems. The process involves:
- Retriever: Identifying and retrieving relevant context.
- Generator: Creating coherent text outputs based on retrieved information.

NLP techniques will be employed to enable the chatbot to:
- Understand human language.
- Interpret and manipulate text effectively.

We currently have two pipelines, a Cohere and an Azure pipeline, which are the result of exploration with various AI tools.
